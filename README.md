Analysis of crime rate in Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬

##  Project Overview
This project is aimed at finding data-driven solutions to solving crime rate in Nigeria. This project also aims to provide insight into the crime rate over the course of three years.
Ultimately, providing recommendation on how to tackle these incidents moving forward.

## Data source
The primary datasource contains variable that gives information like state, city, crime type, date reported, severity and others across the country (Nigeria)

## Analytical tool
The tools used here are Microsoft PowerBI and MySQL.
1. Microsoft PowerBI (reporting) is used to create an interactive dashboard
2. MySQL (data analysis) is used to carry out the analysis.

## Data analysis
Query for the analysis..

## Recommendation

1. Investment in Training: Equip police and investigators with advanced forensic and technological skills.

2. Technology Integration: Adopt modern tools like automated case management systems, AI-driven lead analysis, and biometric identification systems.

3. Resource Allocation:
Target underperforming states with additional funding, personnel, and infrastructure support.
Use data-driven approaches to deploy resources effectively to crime hotspots.

4. Streamline Judicial Processes:
  Implement fast-track courts for specific case types, such as violent crimes.
  
5. Community Engagement:
Foster community-police partnerships to encourage information sharing      and witness cooperation.
Increase public awareness campaigns to address underreporting and improve trust.

6. Data Monitoring and Transparency:
Regularly monitor the percentage of unsolved cases and make data publicly accessible.
Create performance benchmarks for investigative efficiency.

7. Accountability Mechanisms:
Establish independent oversight bodies to review unsolved cases.
Incentivize resolution of cases through performance-based rewards for law enforcement officers.
